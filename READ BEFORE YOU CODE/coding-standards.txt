Do your best to follow the coding standards listed here:
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

We don't have enough time to be too strict about coding standards, but it is worth it to 
at least attempt to have a standard coding format for ease of use and legibility.

Be sure to leave comments on functions if their purposes are not immediately obvious. We
are not professionals and will need some clarification to understand what is going on in
the code.

Also, if any additional setup is required for you to complete your task, please update the
config-guide.txt file to let others know. This will save time and make us more productive!
