Each user story should have its own branch
Upon completion of user story, merge branch into main and remove unneeded branch

Later, when minimum viable product is complete, we will split main into Master and Develop, so we can make changes without
having to risk breaking our MVP, but that's a problem for another time

Proper Workflow:
Clone repository to your local machine
When a change has been made, stage changes and create a pull request into the corresponding user story branch
Write a short description on what you have changed for the pull request
Changes should not be very large, if change requires too many lines, consider splitting task into multiple smaller tasks

IMPORTANT
Unless your changes are very simple (e.g. modifying the developer guide text files), please do not approve your own pull request.
Try to get another member of the team to review it. This will allow us to peer review any changes to make sure there are no bugs 
or inconsistencies being introduced into the code
