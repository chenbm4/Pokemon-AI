Each user story should have its own branch
Upon completion of user story, merge branch into main and remove unneeded branch

Proper Workflow:
Clone repository to your local machine
When a change has been made, stage changes and create a commit into the corresponding user story branch
Write a short description on what you have changed for the commit
Changes should not be very large, if change requires too many lines, consider splitting task into multiple smaller tasks
When user story has been completed, create a pull request to merge the branch into main.
Please do not approve your own pull requests! Try to have another member of the team to review it and approve it for you.
This will allow us to peer review any changes to make sure there are no bugs or inconsistencies being introduced into the code.

Later, when minimum viable product is complete, we will split main into Master and Develop, so we can make changes without
having to risk breaking our MVP, but that's a problem for another time

IMPORTANT
Unless your changes are very simple (e.g. modifying the developer guide text files), please do not commit directly to main.
